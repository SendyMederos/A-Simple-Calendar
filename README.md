It renders the current day at the top of the page and
It displays a timeblocks for the standard business hours
Each timeblock its color coded to indicate whether each hour has past or not, or if we are within that hour 
You can enter events for each hour and saved them so when you reload the page the events persist
It will automatically update at the top of the hour so it stays updated 
It will record each event you are working on automatically at the top of each hour so
You don't lose the event you are working on at that time.
